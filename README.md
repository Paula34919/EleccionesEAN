# EAN Elections

---

This project aims to develop a **Voting System** as an Android application using **Kotlin**. The goal is to provide a secure and easy-to-use platform for both **voters** and **administrators**. The system will be divided into two main panels:

* **Voter Panel**: Allows users to log in, register, and cast their votes.
* **Admin Panel**: Allows administrators to manage elections, add candidates, view results, and manage voter data.

This project is ideal for organizations, communities, or small-scale elections that want to move their voting process to a mobile platform.

## Key Features (Expected)

* **Two Panels (Voters and Admins)**: Separate interfaces for voters and administrators to perform their respective functions.
* **Secure Voting**: Voters can log in securely, register, and cast their votes in a trusted environment.
* **Admin Capabilities**: Admins can manage elections, add candidates, view results, and track election statuses.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: The app will have a simple and intuitive user interface built with **Kotlin** and modern Android UI components.
* **Firebase Integration** (Planned): Firebase will be used for authentication and data management (voter details, election data, results).

## Technologies

This Android Voting System will use the following technologies and tools:

* **Kotlin**: The main programming language for Android development.
* **Android Studio**: The IDE used for building the Android application.
* **Firebase** (Planned): For user authentication, database management, and storing election data.
* **Android SDK**: For developing the mobile app and integrating necessary Android components.

## Conclusion

The **Android Voting System** is an exciting project that aims to provide a reliable, secure, and efficient voting platform for elections, all from the convenience of a mobile app. With **Kotlin** as the primary language and **Firebase** for data management, this project promises to deliver an easy-to-use solution for both voters and administrators. We are currently in the early stages of development, and we welcome contributions to help bring this project to life!
